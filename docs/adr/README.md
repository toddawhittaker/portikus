# Architecture decision records

An architecture decision record (ADR) is a short note about one decision that
shapes the system: what we chose, why, and what it costs. We keep them so that
a new engineer or agent can find the reasoning behind a choice without reading
the whole history of the repository.

## Format

One file per decision, named `NNNN-short-title.md`, numbered in the order the
records are written. Copy `0000-template.md` to start a new one. Each record
has four sections:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Superseded by NNNN, or Deprecated.
- **Context**: the situation that forced a choice.
- **Decision**: what we decided, in the present tense.
- **Consequences**: what this makes easy and what it makes hard.

## Rules

- Keep a record under 40 lines. If it needs more, it is a document, not an ADR.
- Cite the `docs/SPEC.md` and `docs/STACK.md` sections the decision serves.
  Those files remain authoritative; an ADR records the decision, it does not
  replace the specification.
- Records are immutable once accepted. To change a decision, write a new record
  and mark the old one "Superseded by NNNN".
